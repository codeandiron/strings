Two implementations of the C String Copy Algorithm I did as an excercise on buffer overflows. Was originally done as an exercise for a company I interviewed for. One of them uses a loop through the characters, the other uses recursion to file the EOF.

String Copy Question ===========================================
1. To test the recursive implementation of strcpy:
./src/main/c/stringtestrecursive

2. To test the loop implementation of strcpy:
./src/main/c/stringtestloop
